# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
### Purpose
To show how the different campaigns performed based on launch date and goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May was the most successful month. More shows were hosted in May but also had a higher rate of failed theater launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal
Campaigns that had a goal of <1000 to 5000 were the mos successful. Campaigns 45000+ were failed the most and had the lower success rates.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One issue is to make sure the numbers were correct by double checking the formulas for the goals. Other than that I did not encounter any challenges.
## Results
In order to have successul campaigns, the shows should be ran in May and the goals should stay in the range of $0-$5,000. 
For more accurate data, I recoomend looking into each specific year by the launch date to find any outliers in the year.
Also the goals should be broken down by years to find correlation to
